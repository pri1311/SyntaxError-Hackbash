    "Cardboard",
    "How does Cardboard harm the environment? \nCardboard boxes are less harmful and can also be reused. We can reduce packaging by buying in bulk always carry your own packaging bags etc. When cardboard is not contaminated with water, food, or oil it can be recycled. But it also naturally biodegrades so you don’t have to worry about putting it in the recycling bin to break down. \n\nWhat to do with it? \nBoxes for house moving can be used for the house move, and then flat-packed up and stored away, without taking up much space. You can then re-use them when you may need them, or if a friend may need them too you could lend it to them. You could re-use boxes for storage purposes because you may want to keep something away in the attic or garage and they will be perfect for this purpose. You could also reuse them to make things for your children to play with, for example, you could make a children’s playhouse out of them, and paint them and make holes for windows too. Always ensure that the boxes you buy are recyclable too, which you can confirm with the retailer. "

    "Glass",
    "How does glass harm the environment? \nGlass bottles could have an even bigger impact on the environment than plastic ones, a new study has found. Researchers at the University of Southampton in England set out to determine which common beverage containers cause the most and least harm to the environment. They found that glass is actually more detrimental than plastic because it is mined from rare materials and requires more fossil fuels to produce and ship. \n\nWhat to do with it? \nGlass can be melted down and made into many different forms from drinking glasses to glass fiber. When the glass is taken to a manufacturing or recycling plant, it is broken up into smaller pieces called cullet. The broken pieces are crushed, sorted, cleaned, and prepared to be mixed with other raw materials like soda ash and sand. The raw materials and glass pieces are melted in a furnace and then shaped into molds to make new bottles of different colors and sizes. New recycled bottles and jars are made in this way. \n\nWhat is the best alternative for glass? \nScientists have created a new building material that provides an eco-friendly alternative to plastic and glass. Transparent wood has been created out of the desire for efficient building materials that can replace less-sustainable ones. Compared to mainstream construction materials, transparent wood offers impressive energy-efficiency in homes. It provides strong infrastructure, while not compromising the ability to store and release heat. The resulting benefits are a reduction of energy consumption at home and a lower energy bill at the end of the month."

    "Metal",
    "How does metal harm the environment? \nFaced with more and more stringent environmental regulations, nowadays heavy metals are the priority pollutants of surface and ground waters. Many heavy metal ions, such as mercury, cadmium, lead, nickel, and chromium, are known to be very toxic or carcinogenic. \n\nWhat to do with it? \nScrap metals such as aluminum, copper, steel, brass, and iron can be reused many times to make many new products. Recycling scrap metal reduces the amount of waste produced, while also preventing the need for additional mining to obtain new metals for manufacturing purposes. After recycling, scrap metal can be used for a wide variety of purposes, both in the home and in the manufacturing industry. \n\nWhat is the best alternative to metal? \nCobalt, steel, and tantalum are all eco-friendly metals in their own unique ways. \nCobalt: About 15 percent of all cobalt consumption in the United States is sourced from recycled scrap. Many cobalt suppliers work to obtain cobalt through ethical procurement and reduced risk to the earth. \nSteel: This well-known metal is one of the eco-friendliest metals available because so much of it comes from recycled scrap metals, and it is also extraordinarily resistant to wear and tear at a fraction of the cost compared to sterling silver or platinum. \nTantalum: This rare earth metal is a distant cousin of titanium. Although tantalum remains a conflict resource in certain areas of the world, many manufacturers have found sustainable ways to mine this metal."

    "Paper",
    "How does paper harm the environment? \nPaper waste is a big issue in business. If you can reduce paper waste in the workplace, you can have a positive impact on the environment. In fact, the paper makes up the largest part of the un-recycled waste that offices generate. According to research conducted by Kyocera, the average office worker in the UK uses up to 45 pieces of paper per day, and a staggering two-thirds of that is considered waste. Clearly, we need to make some changes to how we dispose of our paper, reduce paper usage, or better yet – learn how to be paperless.  \n\nWhat to do with it? \nEven if you’re a paperless office, there will always be paper products in need of proper disposal, and there are waste paper recycling bins accessible for this. To minimize recyclables being thrown into the garbage, we don’t have personal bins. Our only bins are in the kitchen and tea area. \n\nWhat is the best alternative fpr paper? \nHere are some of the more common labels to look out for next time you go shopping for stationery: Post-Consumer Waste, Kenaf, Bamboo, Agri-Pulp, and Cotton."

    "Plastic",
    "How does plastic harm the environment? \nPlastic sticks around in the environment for ages, threatening wildlife and spreading toxins. Plastic also contributes to global warming. Almost all plastics are made from chemicals that come from the production of planet-warming fuels (gas, oil, and even coal). Our reliance on plastic, therefore, prolongs our demand for these dirty fuels.  Burning plastics in incinerators also releases climate-wrecking gases and toxic air pollution.  \n\nWhat to do with it? \nIt can be used as fuel in the manufacturing of cement, which involves heating limestone in large furnaces at temperatures of 1,450 degrees Celsius until it liquifies. The fuel widely used is coal, of which cement factories burn half a billion tons every year around the planet. \n\nWhat is the best alternative to plastic? \nThe best alternative to single-use plastic is something that you can use over and over again – or something that can be easily recycled or composted. But it isn't always easy to know when you're buying plastic. It can be present in crisp packets, coffee cups, and even teabags. So we've come up with a list of really good alternatives to plastic."

    "Trash",
    "Learn how you can make small changes that are eco-friendly and will have a lasting effect. \n\n1. Use a reusable bottle/cup for beverages on-the-go \nYou might already have a reusable water bottle, but do you use it all the time? You can put that reusable bottle to use, save money, and reduce waste. By taking your own water with you, you’ll also reduce your chances of purchasing more expensive beverages on-the-go. This will eliminate the one-time-use containers they come in. \n\n2. Use reusable grocery bags, and not just for groceries \nJust like a reusable water bottle, you may already have a reusable grocery bag, though it’s often forgotten at home. Try writing BAGS on the top of your grocery list to help you remember, or keep them in the back seat where they aren’t as easy to forget.  \n\n3. Purchase wisely and recycle \nYou can reduce the amount of waste you produce by purchasing products that come with less packaging and/or come in packaging that can be recycled. Not all plastics are recyclable in Delaware, so check labels before your buy. \n\n4. Compost it! \nDid you know as much as 25% of the items in your trash could potentially be removed from the waste stream and composted in your back yard? Your fruit and vegetable scraps, eggshells, coffee grounds, grass clippings, and leaves can all be composted.  \n\n5. Avoid single-use food and drink containers and utensils \nWhenever possible, try to avoid single-use coffee cups, disposable utensils, straws and napkins. Some businesses will even give you a discount on your coffee for bringing your own mug. Keep a set of silverware at work along with a plate, bowl and cup that you can wash and reuse."
